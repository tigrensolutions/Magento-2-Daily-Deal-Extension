<span style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;">When accessing the store, the visitors can see all <em><b>TODAY DEALS, PREVIOUS DEALS,</b></em> and <em><b>COMING DEALS</b></em> on the <em>Daily Deal</em> page. Also, the <em><b>TODAY DEALS</b></em> only will be displayed on the Homepage or Category Page (in the sidebar of these pages) if you would like to. Moreover, in each deal, there is necessary information including product name, original price, discount price, remaining time and quantity to buy, and calculated discount percentage.</span>
Especially, there is a <em>Javascript Countdown Timer</em> showing the time left for a running deal of time before a deal starts. At the same time, this timer can be an efficient tool to hurry the purchasers into making buying decisions, since it makes them scared of losing the chance to buy those items at low prices when the time is running out.

<h2><span style="font-size: medium; color: #000080;"><strong>Freely share attractive deals with friends on social networks</strong></span></h2>
<span style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;">When finding a deal attractive, the customers can easily share that deal with their friends via their social networks such as <em>Facebook</em>, <em>Twitter, </em>and <em>Google Plus, </em>just by clicking on social icons on the Product Page. A tip for the store owners is that the title of the shared link forward to the website should be appealing and speaking enough to catch netizens’ eyes (this title can be modified in the back-end). If more people share your deals, more people will know about your promotion and a higher chance of sale conversion rate will be on hand.

<h2><span style="font-size: medium; color: #000080;"><strong>Subscribe to receive regular daily deal notification</strong></span></h2>
<span style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;">To be regularly updated about the newest deals from their favorite store, the buyers can easily subscribe to receive sales information via their emails.

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-style: italic; color: #ff0000;"><strong>FOR STORE OWNERS</strong></span></p>

<h2><span style="font-size: medium; color: #000080;"><strong>Create a new daily deal with just by few steps</strong></span></h2>
<ul class="features-listing">
 	<li>Step 1: Choose which product in your store to be on sale</li>
 	<li>Step 2: Add a specific time period for sale, exact discount price, and quantity for sale</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"><em><b>Notes:</b></em> Since the administrator can set a specific deal time, they are able to not only create <em>current deals</em> but also <em>future deals</em>. Showing upcoming deals is a very good idea as you will have more time to advertise before the deal happens. More interestingly, the feeling of waiting might strengthen customers’ desire to buy a product.</span>

Also, it is worth noting that it is immensely convenient if you want to conduct a One-price promotion. Instead of creating separate deals for each item, you just need to create only one deal, in which many products are chosen and the deal price is applied for all.

Furthermore, since this module enables new deals to be displayed regularly, the customers can’t help checking your site every day which leads to higher traffics to your website and SEO improvement.
<h2><span style="font-size: medium; color: #000080;"><strong>Track detailed selling records for each deal</strong></span></h2>
<span style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;">This is an immensely useful feature of the <b>Daily Deal Magento Extension</b>. In the admin panel, you can easily access the report of each deal and see their selling progress. To be more particular, in this report there is a line chart that represents the number of sales every single day from the start to the end time of the deal. Below the chart, the number of total sales also is automatically calculated. Furthermore, when the store applies several deals at the same time, these reports might also help the owners to evaluate their effectiveness much easier.

<h2><span style="font-size: medium; color: #000080;"><strong>Easily manage daily deal subscribers</strong></span></h2>
<span style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;">Besides managing deals, the administrator can control the subscription accounts. The high number of deal subscribers might imply that the current promotion campaigns of the store are effective and highly concerned by the customers. On the other hand, the store can take advantage of this valuable contact database to conduct further email marketing campaigns. It is allowable to export the list of daily deal subscribers to use for another purpose or in contrast, import the customer list you've already have into the current subscriber list.</span>
